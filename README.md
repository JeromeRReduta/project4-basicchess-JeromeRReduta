    Helped by:
        Professor Leese's notes on:
            Inheritance
            Exceptions
            In general

        Professor Leese, for help on project

        Thanks for https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11553042/the-system-cannot-find-the-file-specified-in-java
            // taught me how to see if the file I am looking for is in the same director
            // as this file, and showed me that there was one ' at the end
            // of the file name that was screwing it up

        All the articles I read on planning, scoping, and doing a project - didn't do it even close to perfect, but would've failed this one without you

        My computer, which kept randomly not typing the g, h, and " keys for apparently no reason and for which I stupidly might have injured my hands being upset over - but which supported me all the way

        The day, for having 24 hours

        Arturo, can't remember why but thanks

        My body, which powered through this for much longer and for much more often than it should have, and which I can finally let have it's well-deserved 9 hours of re- wait, you say there's video games?!
